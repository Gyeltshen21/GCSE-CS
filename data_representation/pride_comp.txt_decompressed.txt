Chapter 1 

It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in 
possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife. 

However little known the feelings or views of such a man may be 
on his first entering a neighbourhood, this truth is so well 
fixed in the minds of the surrounding families, that he is 
considered the rightful property of some one or other of their 
daughters.
